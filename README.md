# ELK-SIEM + Wazuh Deployment Guide

- Creating an Elasticsearch + Kibana + Wazuh SIEM 

These documents are going to show you how I setup my ELK-SIEM + Wazuh workstations. This process can take a bit to complete and some parts are just import and you are done. Now these installs are two different devices, which are similar. While very different with how you ingest data and install agents. 

-----------------------

- This process was setup on a VMware ESXI 6.7.OU3B  and these machines are running 24/7. 
- Now if you wanna use that process then this setup guide is still the same.

-----------------------



I am trying to make this process simple are straight to the point. So that you can follow along and re-create the same setup that I have created.
